 * RNAFold4j is a port of RNAFold to Java. RNAFold is implemented and developed by Ivo L Hofacker et al.
 * as part of the ViennaRNA package v 1.8.5. All intellectual credits of this work 
 * go to the original authors and the Institute for Theoretical Chemistry of the 
 * University of Vienna. My only contribution is the adaptation of the C source code to Java.
 * 
 * energy constants, formerly defined in
 *           energy_par.h
 *
 * customized for use with RNAedit by
 * S.Kopp, IMB-Jena, Germany, Mar 1996
